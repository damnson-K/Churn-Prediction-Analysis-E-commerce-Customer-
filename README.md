# E-Commerce Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for an e-commerce platform using machine learning. Churn prediction helps businesses retain valuable customers by identifying those at risk of leaving. By leveraging various customer attributes, we aim to build a predictive model that provides insights into churn patterns and improves customer retention strategies.

## 🗂 Dataset Information
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to customer behavior and engagement, including:

- **Tenure**: Length of time the customer has been with the platform
- **WarehouseToHome**: Distance from the warehouse to the customer’s home
- **NumberOfDeviceRegistered**: Number of devices registered by the customer
- **PreferedOrderCat**: Preferred order category
- **SatisfactionScore**: Customer satisfaction score
- **MaritalStatus**: Marital status of the customer
- **NumberOfAddress**: Number of addresses associated with the customer
- **Complain**: Whether the customer has made a complaint (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **DaySinceLastOrder**: Number of days since the last order
- **CashbackAmount**: Cashback amount received by the customer
- **Churn**: Target variable (1 = Churned, 0 = Not Churned)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and detect patterns.
- Preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- Train and evaluate various machine learning models for churn prediction.
- Interpret model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
- Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** (Development Environment)

## 🚀 Project Workflow
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing distributions and correlations
- Analyzing customer behavior patterns

### 3. Model Training & Evaluation
- Training multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
